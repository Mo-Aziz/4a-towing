                  Between an issue with Kiaâ€™s Roadside Service request app not
                  sending over my detailed message and info, and my phone
                  switching itself into sleep mode, Adai had 3 hours of his time
                  wasted this morning, ultimately ending with not being able to
                  tow my vehicle because my keys were stolen and I was unable to
                  put the vehicle in neutral. He was still very friendly and
                  helpful, and told me the type of tow service I needed to
                  request. I figured the least I can do is leave a great review
                  since he tried everything possible

                  The customer service is EXCELLENT! As a USAA member, it took 4
                  companies to finally have this company assigned to tow my car
                  off of an extremely busy and dangerous interstate. The owner
                  of this company took it upon himself to get the work done. He
                  was very professional, polite and assured me that he would get
                  the work done. He did just that. Honest company and one of
                  high integrity. I highly recommend this company.
